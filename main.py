# On Day 19 of 100 days of code I create an etch and sketch game. This is one of a few projects for this day so feel
# free to look around at my code and have fun drawing!

# Importing modules needed
from turtle import Turtle, Screen

etch = Turtle()

# TODO: Create functions for each key stroke

# TODO: Create key strokes for directions

# W is forwards
etch.onclick()
# S is backwards
etch.onclick()
# A is counter-clockwise
etch.onclick()
# D is clockwise
etch.onclick()
# C, clears out the screen for a new drawing
etch.onclick()


screen = Screen()
screen.exitonclick()
